### The history of Activiti Modeler

Activiti Modeler component is as part of the Activiti projectfrom the start. This Modeler was donated by Signavio as part of the [Signavio Core Components project](http://code.google.com/p/signavio-core-components/). This project was not maintained anymoresince 2011 (Activiti 5.7) and Activiti team no longer considered it‘core’ to Activiti.
Tijs Rademakers (the author of Activiti in Action) has spentquite some in his spare time to master, enhance and tweak the ‘oldcode base’, fork the Signavio Core Components project and create acompletely new, maintainable codebase. The Modeler is now perfectly integrated with Activiti Explorer and has all the specific coveragefor Activiti (Activiti 5.11)!
